This is a repository for our project (Aarzu Gupta, Mike Habib, Vivian Su, and Monty Truitt) regarding Self-Supervised learning for Duke University's course on Deep Neural Networks (ECE 661). There are two self-supervised learning frameworks explored: SimCLR (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) and RotNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07728).

The two notebooks in this repo include the core code used to produce the results for our project. Note: some parameters in the notebooks were slightly modified to run the different experiments explored in the project.
